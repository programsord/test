      <p>
        Since I've been listening to you yap for so long, I think its probably your turn to listen
        to me lol. Actually there really isn't much for me to say other than that you are probably
        the best gf I could ask for. You are always there for me and it always brightens up my day
        scrolling through the reels you have sent or even listening to you rant about stuff, it
        allows me to see things from a new perspective! There were so many times which I felt as
        though I wasn't good enough or when I was on the verge of giving up; yet, you were always
        there to inspire me and let me see the bigger picture with your words of affirmation. I hope
        that this gf day, you could also try to take care of yourself rather than always worrying
        about me and rejuvenate some energy. You deserve the break! <br /><br />
        I guess here's some stuff that I've been thinking about lol, which is about you overthinking
        (how ironic). Basically, I don't think its fair for me to make sweeping statements and to
        simply tell you to not do so (like I did many times in the past) as I realised that this
        isn't something that you can change easily. Perhaps I need to understand that this may just
        be your nature rather than always trying to down play it. Instead of telling you to be more
        clear with your communication, I should have done so myself first. Otherwise, you wouldn't
        have been troubled to always subtly hint things to me, maybe to not hurt my feelings. You're
        always so considerate of others that many times you keep things to yourself, I don't think I
        could ever understand your mental fortitude to bottle up so many emotions of your own and
        others constantly. Guess it is my turn to take care of you as well, starting with this
        message. Let it be not just a promise to you but also one to myself. <br /><br />
        I hope that this small gesture is meaningful to you. Maybe you were hoping for something
        more physical but alas, I'm just not artistically inclined. :/ However, it does seem like
        this is something that I need to work on to try to give you what you want rather than what
        is convenient for me. Also, I just want to say how amazing you are for always giving me what
        I needed, be it a listening ear or your gifts and letters, they mean a lot to me! It may
        sound silly but sometimes I would dig up old letters to read to feel better and yours will
        always bring a tear to my eye. Its wonderful how you can write such poetic and simple
        messages so effortlessly! If only this letter was as poetic haiz... Maybe you could teach me
        poetry next time so I can sound a bit more romantic :/ I mean now that I think about it, I
        can't write, can't draw, can't buy you flowers. It's funny isn't it, how everything you want
        I can't provide, or maybe I can and just procrastinate. It's not like I have zero free time
        in the last few weeks, but it seems that I have inadvertently resulted to the backup plan of
        the backup plan ;-;. Truthfully, I've been doing a lot of other stuff that may interest me
        but doesn't help us at all. Guess that's the opportunity cost of spending all my free time
        working on dumb physics simulations and robotics. Now that I think about it, all these are
        quite futile compared to you. Perhaps it was quite irresponsible of me to take on so many
        responsibilities that I neglect you (maybe it's time to finally drop robotics lol). I know
        you have been very tolerant with me the last few months -- always being so empathetic and
        putting up with all my bs excuses. But truely, the affection you gave me really is
        unparalleled. I know that I always say that there's time, but is there really? As we get
        older, there will only be more responsibilities, so maybe now its the best time for me to
        prioritise you. In fact, you have done much more than anyone in my family in terms of
        supporting me, yet why I am I so stubborn to spend time and money on you compared to them?
        Maybe because they are family, but you are more than family at this point :/. I'll try not
        to disappoint you in the future yes :D. <br />

        Here's to an amazing day for my amazing gf. Hopefully you will be able to enjoy this special
        day by trying to sleep earlier as well. (I should also probably tell that to myself) Welp
        anyways, it seems like I have a long way to go to truly allow you to let go of the weight on
        your shoulders. Just know that I'll be there to shoulder any hardships with you in the
        future. <br />
